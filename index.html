<p>Hi, everyone.Welcome to my homepage!</p>
<p>My name is Zean Han, an mphil student of the mathematical department of CUHK. </p>
<p>You can contact me through my email: zhan@math.cuhk.edu.hk.</p>
<p>My interest lies in applied probability, stochastic modeling and operations research.</p>
<p>I used to love algebraic geometry and geometric representation theory, two elegant topics in pure mathematics. </p>
<p>During my Mphil life, I am exploring the world of geometric representation, especially perverse sheaves, perverse filtrations and its applications on hypertoric varieties.<br>
I think 2025 would be my final goodbye to a pure mathematics life.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I love photograph, classical guitar and watching movies.</p>
<p>My favorite pieces of music are Asturias by Isaac Albéniz and Recuerdos de la Alhambra by Francisco Tárrega. My favorite performer is John Williams.</p>
<p>I write reviews of the movies that I love from time to time. You can find my movie reviews in the link below. All of them are written in Chinese.</p>
