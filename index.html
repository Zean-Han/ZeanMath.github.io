<p>Hi, everyone</p>
<p>My name is Zean Han, an mphil student of the mathematical department of CUHK. </p>
<p>My interest lies in computer vision , natrual language processing and machine learning.</p>
<p>I used to love algebraic geometry and geometric representation theory. But due to some non-academic reasons, I made up my mind to change my major and quit Mathematics.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I love photograph, classical guitar and watching movies.</p>

<p>I write reviews of the movies that I love from time to time. You can find my movie reviews in the link below. All of them are written in Chinese.</p>
